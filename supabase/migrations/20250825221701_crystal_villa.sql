  # Permanently disable RLS for contact submissions

  Since the contact form needs to work for anonymous users and RLS policies
  keep blocking submissions, we'll disable RLS on this table permanently.
  
  This is acceptable for a contact form table since:
  - It only contains contact inquiries (not sensitive user data)
  - Anonymous users need to submit forms
  - Data is write-only for public users
